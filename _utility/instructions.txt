Please note:
- Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
- Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
- Inside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
- In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.
- In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greedily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_**__, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.
